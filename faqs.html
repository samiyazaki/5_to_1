        <h1>FAQs</h1>
        <h2> Balancing carbohydrates with fiber is an important component of a healthy diet that can help individuals feel fuller for longer periods and maintain a healthy weight. Carbohydrates are essential macronutrients that provide energy to the body, but not all carbs are created equal. Some carbs, like those found in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, are high in fiber, while others, like those found in refined grains, sugary drinks, and snacks, are low in fiber.

            Fiber is a type of carbohydrate that the body cannot digest, and it plays a crucial role in maintaining digestive health, regulating blood sugar levels, and promoting satiety. A diet that is high in fiber and low in processed carbohydrates has been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer.
            
            The ideal ratio of carbohydrates to fiber is 5:1 or less, meaning that for every five grams of carbohydrates consumed, there should be at least one gram of fiber. By balancing carbohydrates with fiber, individuals can maintain stable blood sugar levels, feel fuller for longer periods, and avoid overeating. This can lead to weight loss and improved overall health.
            
            Foods that are high in fiber include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and seeds. Some easy ways to increase fiber intake include adding more fruits and vegetables to meals, choosing whole-grain bread, pasta, and cereals, and snacking on nuts and seeds.
            
            In conclusion, balancing carbohydrates with fiber is an essential component of a healthy diet that can help individuals maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. By aiming for a 5:1 or less ratio of carbohydrates to fiber, individuals can improve their overall health and wellbeing.</h2>

					<h2>How does the Calculator work?</h2>
					<p>The Calculator takes two inputs: the amount of carbohydrates and the amount of fiber in a food. It then calculates the ratio of carbohydrates to fiber and displays the result. The ratio can be used to determine if a food is a good source of fiber or if it is high in carbohydrates.</p>

					<h2>Is the Calculator accurate?</h2>
                        <p>The Calculator is based on a standard calculation for the ratio of carbohydrates to fiber. While it should provide a good estimate of the ratio, it is important to keep in mind that there can be variations in the actual amounts of carbohydrates and fiber in a food depending on factors such as processing, preparation, and growing conditions.</p>

                        <h2>Can the Calculator be used for all types of foods?</h2>
                        <p>The Calculator can be used for most foods that have both carbohydrates and fiber. However, it is important to note that the ratio of carbohydrates to fiber can vary widely depending on the food. For example, fruits and vegetables tend to have a higher fiber content compared to processed foods.</p>
