					<h2>How does the Calculator work?</h2>
					<p>The Calculator takes two inputs: the amount of carbohydrates and the amount of fiber in a food. It then calculates the ratio of carbohydrates to fiber and displays the result. The ratio can be used to determine if a food is a good source of fiber or if it is high in carbohydrates.</p>

					<h2>Is the Calculator accurate?</h2>
                        <p>The Calculator is based on a standard calculation for the ratio of carbohydrates to fiber. While it should provide a good estimate of the ratio, it is important to keep in mind that there can be variations in the actual amounts of carbohydrates and fiber in a food depending on factors such as processing, preparation, and growing conditions.</p>

                        <h2>Can the Calculator be used for all types of foods?</h2>
                        <p>The Calculator can be used for most foods that have both carbohydrates and fiber. However, it is important to note that the ratio of carbohydrates to fiber can vary widely depending on the food. For example, fruits and vegetables tend to have a higher fiber content compared to processed foods.</p>
